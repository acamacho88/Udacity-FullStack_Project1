Alex Camacho - 6/13/15

This is for PROJECT 1 of the Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree

To run the program, open a command prompt, change directory to the folder
containing the two python files "fresh_tomatoes.py" and "moviesclass.py",
and run the following command:

python fresh_tomatoes.py

The program will create the HTML file necessary, then open it in the default
browser.

I added a dashed border to the movie boxes and a few extra fields including
an IMDB link.  Since clicking it would first bring up the YouTube video for
a couple seconds, I changed the functionality in the javascript to only open
the video if the poster is clicked, and relegated the cursor icon to only on
top of the poster.

Both python files have been commented, I added a "Camacho" at the beginning
of each one so they can be easily searched.
